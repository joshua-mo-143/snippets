## A web service for storing and sharing your web snippets.

## Architecture
- `database`: A crate that holds code for interacting with databases.
- `frontend`: A web frontend (using Next.js).
- `search`: The search module. Deals with full text search (and potentially other kinds of search in the future).
- `webservice`: The actual web service itself.

Feel free to browse through each folder to find the respective (feature) roadmaps.
